🛡️ Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Bank Transactions
Data Science Project for Adey Innovations Inc.
📋 Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the security of e-commerce and banking transactions by building sophisticated fraud detection models. By leveraging geolocation analysis, transaction patterns, and advanced machine learning (XGBoost), we identify fraudulent activities while maintaining a smooth user experience.
A core focus of this project is managing the trade-off between Security (catching fraud) and User Experience (minimizing false alarms).

⚙️ Workflow & Tasks
Task 1: Data Analysis and Preprocessing
IP Mapping: Converted IP addresses to integer format and merged with IpAddress_to_Country.csv to identify geographic fraud patterns.
Feature Engineering: Created high-impact features such as time_since_signup (difference between signup and purchase) and transaction frequency.
Handling Imbalance: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to the training set to address the extreme class imbalance (0.17% fraud in banking data).
Task 2: Modeling & Statistical Rigor
We implemented a baseline Logistic Regression and a Tuned XGBoost Ensemble.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize max_depth, learning_rate, and scale_pos_weight.
5-Fold Cross-Validation: Ensured model stability across different data subsets.
Model Comparison Table
Model	Dataset	AUC-PR	F1-Score	Recall	Justification
Logistic Regression	E-commerce	0.52	0.45	0.51	Baseline: Low recall, misses many fraud cases.
Tuned XGBoost	E-commerce	0.81	0.78	0.74	Selected: Strongest balance of precision/recall.
Logistic Regression	Bank	0.69	0.62	0.58	Baseline: Struggles with extreme imbalance.
Tuned XGBoost	Bank	0.89	0.84	0.82	Selected: Robust performance on PCA features.
Note: Metrics prioritized AUC-PR and Recall due to the high business cost of False Negatives (missed fraud).
Task 3: Model Explainability (SHAP)
Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we deconstructed the "black-box" XGBoost model to understand fraud drivers:
Global Importance: time_since_signup was the #1 predictor—fraudsters often act immediately after account creation.
Local Importance: Force plots revealed that high purchase_value in specific countries significantly pushes the risk score higher.
💡 Business Recommendations
Based on SHAP and EDA results, we recommend the following for Adey Innovations:
Implement a "Cool-off" Period: Accounts making purchases within 10 minutes of signup should trigger a mandatory 24-hour hold or manual identity verification.
Adaptive MFA: Transactions exceeding $200 from countries identified as "High Risk" in our SHAP analysis should require Multi-Factor Authentication (OTP).
Velocity Thresholds: Implement automated blocks for any Device ID linked to more than 3 unique User IDs within a 24-hour window, as this pattern strongly correlates with fraudulent activity.
## 💡 Final Business Insights & Recommendations
Based on SHAP explainability:
1. **High-Velocity Fraud:** `time_since_signup` is the strongest predictor. **Recommendation:** Any transaction within 5 minutes of account creation should require 3D-Secure (OTP) verification.
2. **Value Thresholds:** Fraud increases with `purchase_value` in specific regions. **Recommendation:** Implement a manual review trigger for first-time purchases over $150 from high-risk countries.
3. **Identity Verification:** Device ID reuse across multiple User IDs is a major red flag. **Recommendation:** Permanently ban Device IDs linked to >3 fraudulent accounts.
